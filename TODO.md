- [ ] Separate web interface from computation engine
- [ ] Create dedicated model inference service
- [ ] Implement async job processing
- [ ] Add Redis/queue system for background tasks
- [ ] Create API gateway for service coordination

**Benefits**:
- Scalable architecture
- Independent service deployment
- Better resource allocation
