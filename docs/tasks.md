## üöß Current Implementation Gap

### ‚ùå MISSING: Image Upload Functionality
**Status**: Not implemented  
**Impact**: Core functionality unavailable - users cannot upload images for analysis  
**Priority**: CRITICAL - blocks primary use case

**Missing Components**:
- Web upload endpoints (`POST /api/upload`)
- Frontend upload interface (drag & drop, file selection)
- Image processing pipeline integration
- Real-time analysis workflow
- User session management for uploads

---

## üéØ Upcoming Implementation Phases

### Phase A: Basic Image Upload Functionality (NEXT - Estimated: 4-6 hours)

#### A.1 Backend Upload Endpoint (2-3 hours)
- [ ] **File upload endpoint**: `POST /api/upload` with multipart/form-data
- [ ] **File validation**: Format checking (JPEG, PNG), size limits (10MB)
- [ ] **Error handling**: Comprehensive validation and error responses
- [ ] **Temporary storage**: Secure file handling and cleanup

#### A.2 Frontend Upload Interface (2-3 hours)
- [ ] **Upload UI components**: Drag & drop area, file selection button
- [ ] **Progress indicators**: Upload progress bar, processing status
- [ ] **Preview functionality**: Image thumbnails, metadata display
- [ ] **Error display**: User-friendly error messages and retry options

#### A.3 Analysis Pipeline Integration (1-2 hours)
- [ ] **Upload ‚Üí Analysis flow**: Connect upload to existing inference pipeline
- [ ] **Asynchronous processing**: Background analysis with status updates
- [ ] **Result storage**: Save analysis results to database
- [ ] **Result display**: Show diversity analysis results to user

**Phase A Completion Criteria**:
- Users can upload images via web interface
- Images are automatically processed through iNatAg pipeline
- Diversity analysis results are displayed in real-time
- All 273 tests continue to pass

### Phase B: Advanced Upload Features (Estimated: 6-8 hours)

#### B.1 Batch Upload System (3-4 hours)
- [ ] **Multi-file upload**: Support for uploading multiple images simultaneously
- [ ] **Batch processing**: Efficient processing of image batches
- [ ] **Progress tracking**: Per-file and overall batch progress
- [ ] **Partial failure handling**: Continue processing when some files fail

#### B.2 Analysis History & Session Management (3-4 hours)
- [ ] **User sessions**: Organize uploads into analysis sessions
- [ ] **History tracking**: View previous analysis results
